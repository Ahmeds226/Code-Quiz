# Code-Quiz

For this project, I have made a JavaScript quiz. Initially, I made two HTML files, index and scores, styled both with CSS and made a js file.
Furthermore:

1. I made a timer function.
2. The timer function is dependent on whether the user gets the answer right or wrong.
3. The game also stores the user's score on local storage.
